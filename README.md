# ✈️ 3D Digital Twin of GSO Airport in Unity: First Phase Development and Future Vision

---

## 📋 Project Overview

This project represents the first phase in exploring the creation of a 3D digital twin of Greensboro's Piedmont Triad International Airport (GSO) using Unity.
The purpose is to establish a foundation for future research into predictive maintenance, incident prevention, AI-based monitoring, and simulation-driven airport planning.

This phase includes:
- Importing real-world geographic data
- Modeling the airport in Blender and Unity
- Aircraft movement across placed waypoints
- Setting up multi-camera monitoring systems

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. Install Unity 2022.3 LTS.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Open `/unity-project/` inside Unity Editor.
4. Open the main scene to view and simulate.
5. (Optional) Install Blender 4.0 if modifications to 3D models are needed.
6. (Optional) Install Python 3.8+ if preprocessing data is necessary.

## 🛠️ Aircraft Movement System

- Aircraft currently follows a sequence of manually placed **waypoints**:
  - (Gate → Taxiway → Runway Start → Runway End → Takeoff Point)
- Smooth rotation and acceleration behavior scripted.

**Future Enhancement:**
- Allow users to input **real-world GPS coordinates** directly.
- Automatic path generation based on entered coordinates.

---

## 🔍 Expected Output and Verification

- Aircraft taxis and lifts off based on waypoint paths.
- Four simultaneous camera views: Top-Down, Side View, Plane-Follow, Ground Level.
- Stable scene rendering without flickering or object misalignment.
